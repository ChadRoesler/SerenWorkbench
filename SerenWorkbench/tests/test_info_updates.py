"""
GET / carries an update-status block.

These test the CONTRACT rather than a particular answer, because the answer
legitimately varies with the environment: whether seren-meninges[updates] is
installed, whether the box has a network, whether the operator switched it off.
What must never vary is that there IS a status, that it is one of the four
known values, and that the key set is stable — anything rendering this (the
dashboard badge, a monitoring probe) reads those keys unconditionally.

The conftest `offline_update_checks` fixture guarantees no real index call.
